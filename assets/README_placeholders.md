Add these files to customize the site visuals:

- assets/logo.png  (square, ~512x512)
- assets/favicon.png (32x32 or 64x64). You can also use assets/favicon.svg
- assets/nfts/1.png ... assets/nfts/6.png (any size, square recommended)

If favicon or logo files are missing, the site still works; gallery images will auto-fallback to generated SVGs. After adding your images, keep the same filenames.
